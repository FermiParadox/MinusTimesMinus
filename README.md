This program provides randomly generated math exercises with the 
intention to help a prehighschool student practice on addition 
or multiplication of integers and decimals. Also, keeps track of user's 
progress and rewards them.

In has several difficulty levels, which affect how many terms are 
presented to the user and whether the terms will be integers or decimals. 


	Examples of exercises: 
	-1+2=
	+10-4-9=
	(-4)(+9)= 
	+7.2-2.9=
	
The user is notified if the answer is correct 
or not and is rewarded for each successful answer, 
as well as for playing consistently. E.g. there are 
rewards awarded for playing 30 days in a row (at least one correct answer 
is needed per day).
