In has several difficulty levels, which affect how many terms are 
presented to the user and whether the terms will be integers or decimals. 


	Examples of exercises: 
	-1+2=
	+10-4-9=
	(-4)(+9)= 
	+7.2-2.9=
	
The user is notified if the answer is correct 
or not and is rewarded for each successful answer, 
as well as for playing consistently. E.g. there are 
rewards awarded for playing 30 days in a row (at least 
one correct answer is needed per day).   


# Goals
## Gamification
It must feel like a game. This will keep the 
student practicing willingly, meaning it will increase 
his performance and time spent studying. 

## Practice often
In order to complete the achievements the student must 
play in regular intervals. They learn concepts faster 
and for longer when they are repeated frequently. 
Resulting in self-esteem increase.  

## No distractions 
I intentionally didn't make it more flashy and prettier 
because the student must be focused only on the task. 
Also, there are no ads in the app for the very same reason.
