PRIVACY POLICY

Only user's progress in the game is stored. 
That data is never shared, and remains in the user's device itself. 

No other data is used, shared, or collect. 

There are some extra permissions asked when installing the app,
without actually being used (eg. photos), but this is Kivy related, 
and it will be fixed in the future.
